This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Option 2 – Flight Search Web App (API Integration)

Goal: Create a basic flight search web application using the Amadeus Flight Offers API.
API Docs:
👉 https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-search

Requirements:
• Use a form to take: origin, destination, date, and passengers
• Show flight results (airline, stops, price, etc.)
• Responsive UI and good UX
• Hosted on GitHub (with screenshots)

🔐 Note: You'll need to sign up for a free Amadeus Developer account and use the sandbox API key.

👉 Design Suggestion like this site:
✈️ Skyscanner
🔗 https://www.skyscanner.net/

✈️ Google Flights
🔗 https://www.google.com/flights

✈️ Kiwi.com
🔗 https://www.kiwi.com/

Or any kind of flight search website.

[ You may take inspiration from popular platforms like Skyscanner, Google Flights, or Kiwi.com in terms of layout, UX, and responsiveness.
However, please do not copy code, only use as a design and UX reference. ]
